    description: 
      - Teams that have recently started using programming languages may need to start thinking about using version control to track changes to their code.
      - With code running on laptops comes a very high chance of sensitive data lying around on laptop hard-drives. This could present a serious compliance problem if the data contains personal information.
      - With people using their own laptops and not checking code into git for peer review there is often high error rates and less opportunity for collaboration between team members.

Skill Sprints are designed to guide two or three individuals to deliver something with the new technology with the support, guidance and motivation of an expert. This managed process dramatically reduces the Time to First Value.
