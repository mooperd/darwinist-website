        The Git Skill Sprint is designed for a team that are already writing code to solve problems but are suffering from change control, visibility and safety problems. 
        Our customers are typically teams of analysts that are in the process of moving away from desktop tools like Excel and are finding it difficult to keep track of changes.

    - subtitle: Compliance 
      text: In certain businesses such as finance or insurance there is a requirement that all systems that affect decision making are subject to strict change control and four eyes principles. Git handles these requirements quite perfectly.
