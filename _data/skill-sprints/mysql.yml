      - subtitle: Structured storage of data
        text: I really have to think carefully about the problem and solution of MYSQL skill sprints. Are we talking about only extracting data?
      - With code running on laptops comes a very high chance of sensitive data lying around on laptop hard-drives. This could present a serious compliance problem if the data contains personal information.
      - With people using their own laptops and not checking code into git for peer review there is often high error rates and less opportunity for collaboration between team members.

    description: 
      - Introducing new technologies into a business is a difficult task which is often a long drawn out - tortuous affair. Skill Sprints are designed to guide two or three individuals to deliver something with the new technology with the support, guidance and motivation of an expert. This managed process dramatically reduces the Time to First Value.
